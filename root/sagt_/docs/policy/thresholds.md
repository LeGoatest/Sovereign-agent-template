# Thresholds (Policy)

This file suggests practical thresholds for detecting governance stress.

This file is non-canonical unless explicitly promoted into canon via mutation.
Canon prevails.

## Suggested Thresholds

### Deep Mode Frequency
If deep_mode_entered occurs in > 30% of runs over a rolling window:
- Likely canon ambiguity or missing patterns
- Trigger governance review

### Deep Mode Pass Count
If pass 3 is reached in > 20% of deep runs:
- Likely unresolved ambiguity
- Consider strengthening canon wording or adding negative examples

### HITL Escalation Rate
If HITL occurs in > 15% of runs:
- Check task group classification clarity
- Check protected zone definitions
- Check enforcement matrix completeness

### Refusal Rate
If refusal > 20% over rolling window:
- Canon may be incomplete or overly rigid
- Evaluate whether mutation pathways exist

### Mutation Required Rate
If mutation-required triggers > 10%:
- Governance model may be evolving rapidly
- Review whether canon scope is stable

Thresholds should be tuned empirically.
Do not optimize for “low refusal” at the expense of authority clarity.
