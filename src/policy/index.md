# Policy Overview

The Policy layer monitors governance health over time.

Canon defines what is allowed.
Governance enforces rules during execution.
Policy observes systemic patterns across executions.

Policy does not override authority.
It detects instability.

## Purpose of Policy

Even strictly enforced systems drift gradually.

Policy exists to:

- Detect shadow architecture trends
- Monitor refusal frequency
- Track mutation patterns
- Identify protected zone pressure
- Detect governance fatigue

Policy is the observability backbone of SAGT.

## Policy Is Not Canon

Canon answers:
> Is this allowed?

Policy answers:
> Is the system stable?

Policy escalates.
It does not redefine authority.
