# Determinism

Determinism in SAGT means:

Given:
- The same canon version
- The same approved spec
- The same inputs
- The same task group
- The same skill set

The system must converge toward equivalent output.

If this guarantee cannot be upheld, execution must halt.

Determinism is not about identical token output.
It is about structural equivalence under identical authority conditions.

## Why Determinism Matters

AI systems are probabilistic.

Without deterministic governance:

- Architectural outcomes drift across sessions.
- Multi-model execution diverges.
- Mutation becomes untraceable.
- Auditability collapses.
- Long-term stability degrades.

Determinism transforms probabilistic reasoning into governed structure.

## Determinism Boundaries

SAGT does not require byte-level equality.

It requires:

- Equivalent structural decisions
- Equivalent enforcement adherence
- Equivalent invariant preservation
- Equivalent task ordering

Stylistic differences are acceptable.
Structural divergence is not.

---

## Sources of Non-Determinism

Common sources include:

- Ambiguous canon rules
- Equal-precedence conflicts
- Implicit architectural assumptions
- Missing enforcement semantics
- Skill authority expansion
- Untracked mutation
- Policy threshold drift
- Context-dependent reasoning

SAGT detects these conditions and halts execution.

---

## Determinism Enforcement Mechanisms

Determinism is preserved through:

- Canon precedence enforcement
- Structured rule compilation
- Protected zones
- Spec-first workflow
- Explicit task group classification
- Skill authority limits
- HITL escalation
- Handover state externalization
- Canon version logging

Each mechanism removes hidden variability.

## Determinism and Versioning

Canon version must be recorded in every execution log.

Two executions using different canon versions are not required to match.

Determinism is scoped to canon version.

Mutation introduces new determinism boundaries.

---

## Determinism and Multi-Model Execution

SAGT is model-agnostic.

If two different models execute:

- They must converge structurally.
- If divergence occurs, governance failure exists.

Differences in reasoning language are irrelevant.
Differences in structural decisions are not.

---

## Determinism Failure Behavior

If determinism cannot be guaranteed:

- The agent must halt.
- Emit:

[AWAIT_HUMAN_VALIDATION]

Execution must not proceed under uncertainty.

Continuing would introduce hidden authority.

---

## Determinism Is Structural, Not Behavioral

SAGT governs structure, not creativity.

Agents may vary in explanation style.
They may vary in wording.
They may vary in minor formatting.

They must not vary in:

- Invariant enforcement
- Protected zone respect
- Mutation process adherence
- Task group isolation

---

## Determinism and Long-Term Stability

Determinism ensures:

- Reproducible builds
- Auditable governance history
- Safe model upgrades
- Stable mutation cycles
- Consistent enforcement

Without determinism, governance becomes advisory.

---

Determinism is the measurable guarantee of structural stability in SAGT.
