# Reference Overview

The Reference section defines the foundational guarantees of SAGT.

These are not workflows.
They are structural properties.

Reference documents define the invariants that make SAGT reliable.

---

## Purpose of Reference

Reference documents clarify:

- What determinism means
- When refusal must occur
- How enforcement is triggered
- How authority boundaries are preserved

They provide the theoretical backbone of the framework.

---

## Components of Reference

### Determinism
Defines structural convergence requirements.

### Refusal Model
Defines mandatory boundary enforcement behavior.

---

## Why Reference Exists

Governance frameworks often fail because:

- Enforcement semantics are unclear
- Determinism is assumed but undefined
- Refusal behavior is inconsistent
- Authority boundaries blur over time

Reference documents eliminate ambiguity.

## Reference and Canon

Canon defines law.
Reference defines properties that law must preserve.

Reference pages describe guarantees.
Canon enforces them.

---

Reference defines what makes SAGT stable.
