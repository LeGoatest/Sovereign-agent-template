# Governance Overview

The Governance layer defines how authority is exercised inside SAGT.

Canon defines law.
Governance defines execution behavior under that law.

Governance is where theory becomes operational discipline.

It prevents structural drift during real execution.

---

## Purpose of Governance

Governance exists to ensure that:

- Agents do not reinterpret canon
- Authority boundaries are respected
- Architecture does not emerge implicitly
- Security assumptions are not inferred
- Determinism is preserved

Governance enforces separation between intent, procedure, and authority.

## Components of Governance

The Governance section includes:

### Task Groups
Defines intent classification and separation of concerns.
Every request maps to exactly one task group.

### Skills
Procedural execution units.
Skills execute known procedure and cannot introduce architecture.

### Spec Workflow
Temporal control system separating planning from execution.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
Explicit break-glass protocol for authority escalation.

### Shadow Architecture
Detection and response model for unauthorized structural patterns.

### Handover Protocol
Ensures governance continuity across sessions and model switches.

## Governance and Canon

Governance operates under canon authority.

If governance mechanisms conflict with canon:
canon prevails.

Governance does not reinterpret canon.
It enforces it.

---

## Governance and Policy

Governance enforces rules at execution time.

Policy observes patterns across time.

Governance handles immediate boundaries.
Policy detects long-term instability.

---

## Governance Failure Modes

Governance degrades when:

- Task groups blur
- Skills expand authority
- Spec-first is skipped
- HITL is bypassed
- Shadow patterns are normalized
- Handover state is ignored

Governance must remain strict to preserve determinism.

---

Governance is the execution discipline layer of SAGT.
It ensures authority is respected in motion.
