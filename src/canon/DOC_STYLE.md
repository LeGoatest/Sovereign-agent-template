# DOC_STYLE

This document defines writing rules for canonical documents.

Canonical docs must be readable by humans and enforceable by tools.

Style is not cosmetic. It reduces ambiguity.

---

## 1. Normative Language

Canonical rules must use clear modal verbs:

- MUST
- MUST NOT
- SHOULD (rare; only where explicitly non-binding)
- MAY (rare; only where explicitly optional)

Avoid vague phrasing such as:
- “try to”
- “generally”
- “it would be best”
- “ideally”

Ambiguity triggers refusal.

---

## 2. Rule Formatting

Rules should be numbered and titled.

Each rule should include:

- statement
- scope
- enforcement outcome (or reference to Enforcement Matrix)

If enforcement is not defined, the rule is incomplete.

---

## 3. Prose vs Law

Canonical prose may explain intent, but cannot override rules.

If a prose paragraph conflicts with a rule statement, the rule wins.

---

## 4. Cross-References

When referencing another canonical doc:

- link to the exact file
- prefer section anchors if stable
- avoid duplicating rules in multiple documents

Duplication increases conflict risk.

---

## 5. Change Discipline

Any modification to canonical documents requires mutation.

Minor wording changes can alter enforcement interpretation.
Therefore, canon changes are never casual.

---

## 6. Non-Canonical Documents

Non-canonical files must include a clear disclaimer:

“Non-canonical. Canon prevails.”

This prevents accidental authority elevation.

---

This document exists to prevent governance drift through language ambiguity.
