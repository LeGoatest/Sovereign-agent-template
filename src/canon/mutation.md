# Canon Mutation

Canon Mutation is the formal process by which canonical authority may change.

It is the only legal mechanism for modifying:

- Invariants
- Precedence rules
- Protected Zones
- Enforcement semantics
- Governance boundaries

All other modification attempts must halt execution.

Mutation is rare by design.

## Why Mutation Must Be Formal

AI systems naturally adapt.

Without structured mutation:

- Architecture shifts silently.
- Precedence rules erode.
- Enforcement becomes inconsistent.
- Historical determinism is lost.

Formal mutation prevents incremental drift.

It forces visibility before change.

---

## When Mutation Is Required

Mutation is required if:

- A Protected Zone is modified.
- A new invariant is introduced.
- Enforcement behavior changes.
- Precedence ordering changes.
- A shadow pattern must be legitimized.
- Compiler schema evolves.
- Governance boundaries shift.

If change impacts structural authority, mutation is mandatory.

## Mutation Workflow

A Canon Mutation must include:

1. Mutation Proposal  
   - Description of change  
   - Scope of impact  
   - Justification  

2. Impact Analysis  
   - Affected rules  
   - Affected enforcement behaviors  
   - Downstream governance implications  
   - Determinism impact  

3. Compatibility Review  
   - Backward compatibility status  
   - Migration path (if required)  

4. Version Increment  
   - Canon version bump  
   - Change log entry  

5. Human Validation  

Without all five, mutation is invalid.

---

## Mutation Refusal Conditions

Mutation must be rejected if:

- It introduces ambiguity.
- It reduces enforcement clarity.
- It weakens invariant protection.
- It collapses separation of concerns.
- It bypasses protected zones indirectly.
- It creates circular precedence overrides.

Mutation must improve clarity, not reduce it.

---

## Mutation and Versioning

Canon versioning is mandatory.

Every mutation increments version.

Execution logs must record:

- Canon version
- Mutation ID (if applicable)

This enables:

- Reproducibility
- Historical audit
- Multi-model stability
- Rollback capability

Unversioned mutation destroys determinism.

---

## Mutation and Shadow Patterns

Shadow patterns occur when agents introduce architectural behavior not explicitly authorized by canon.

When detected, the agent must choose:

A) Remove the pattern  
B) Initiate mutation  

Mutation formalizes the pattern.

Silent adoption is prohibited.

---

## Mutation Granularity

Mutation should be:

- Minimal
- Explicit
- Isolated

Broad mutation increases systemic risk.

Small, well-scoped mutation preserves stability.

---

## Mutation and Policy

Policy Engine monitors mutation frequency.

Excessive mutation may indicate:

- Canon incompleteness
- Overly rigid governance
- Poor initial rule modeling

Policy does not prevent mutation.
It surfaces systemic instability.

---

## Mutation Failure Modes

Improper mutation leads to:

- Inconsistent enforcement
- Canon contradiction
- Protected Zone weakening
- Drift disguised as evolution

Mutation must strengthen clarity.

If clarity decreases, mutation must be rejected.

Canon Mutation is the evolution valve of SAGT.

It ensures that governance can adapt
without sacrificing determinism or integrity.
