# Governance Maturity Model

The Governance Maturity Model defines progressive levels of SAGT adoption.

It allows teams to assess:

- Structural stability
- Drift resistance
- Enforcement consistency
- Mutation discipline
- Determinism guarantees

Maturity is not about complexity.
It is about structural integrity.

---

## Level 0 — Informal Governance

Characteristics:

- No explicit canon.
- Architecture evolves implicitly.
- Agents optimize locally.
- No refusal model.
- No mutation workflow.
- No deterministic guarantees.

At this level:

- Drift is continuous.
- Security assumptions are implicit.
- Architectural decisions accumulate without review.

Most AI-assisted projects operate here.

## Level 1 — Canon Defined

Characteristics:

- Canon documents exist.
- Precedence is declared.
- Protected zones are defined.
- Mutation workflow exists.

Limitations:

- No compiler validation.
- Policy metrics not tracked.
- HITL may be inconsistent.
- Skills may overreach occasionally.

This level prevents obvious drift but not subtle erosion.

---

## Level 2 — Structured Enforcement

Characteristics:

- Canon includes structured rule blocks.
- Canon Compiler validates integrity.
- Enforcement matrix generated.
- Refusal model consistently applied.
- HITL protocol enforced strictly.

At this level:

- Canon contradictions are caught automatically.
- Protected zone modifications require mutation.
- Structural violations halt execution.

Governance is mechanically enforced.

---

## Level 3 — Observability Enabled

Characteristics:

- Policy Engine active.
- Telemetry logged.
- Refusal rates tracked.
- Shadow patterns detected.
- Mutation frequency monitored.
- TTL review active.

At this level:

- Drift is detected before it accumulates.
- Governance pressure is visible.
- Structural instability trends are measurable.

Governance becomes proactive.

---

## Level 4 — Deterministic Continuity

Characteristics:

- Canon version logged per execution.
- Handover protocol consistently applied.
- Multi-model continuity validated.
- Spec-first strictly enforced.
- Compiler required before execution.

At this level:

- Reproducibility is guaranteed.
- Model switching does not alter outcomes.
- Structural divergence is traceable.
- Governance survives time.

This is production-grade governance.

---

## Level 5 — Adaptive Governance

Characteristics:

- Mutation is minimal and deliberate.
- Policy thresholds tuned empirically.
- Shadow pressure used to evolve canon intentionally.
- Governance review cadence institutionalized.
- Compiler schema evolves under mutation discipline.

At this level:

- Governance adapts without drifting.
- Evolution is structured.
- Stability and flexibility coexist.

Very few systems reach this level.

## Why Maturity Matters

Governance is binary in theory but gradual in practice.

A team may believe they are governed while operating at Level 1.

The maturity model provides:

- Honest assessment
- Roadmap for improvement
- Audit framework
- Organizational alignment

## Anti-Patterns by Level

Level 0:
- "The agent usually does the right thing."

Level 1:
- Canon exists but mutation is casual.

Level 2:
- Compiler active but policy ignored.

Level 3:
- Metrics collected but not reviewed.

Level 4:
- Determinism claimed but not logged.

Level 5:
- Mutation becomes frequent again (
