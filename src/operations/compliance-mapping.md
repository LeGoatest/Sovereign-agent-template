# Compliance & Audit Mapping

SAGT is not a compliance standard.

However, its governance structure can be mapped to common assurance frameworks such as:

- ISO-style governance controls
- SOC-style internal control systems
- Change management standards
- Secure development lifecycle models
- Risk management frameworks

This document explains how SAGT aligns structurally with audit expectations.

## Why Compliance Mapping Matters

Enterprise adoption requires:

- Traceability
- Version control
- Change approval records
- Structural integrity checks
- Enforcement evidence
- Deterministic process controls

SAGT provides these structurally.

Mapping makes them visible to auditors.

---

## Governance as Control System

SAGT can be viewed as a layered control system:

- Canon → Policy Definition Layer
- Compiler → Structural Validation Layer
- Spec Workflow → Change Management Layer
- HITL → Approval Control Layer
- Mutation → Formal Change Control
- Policy Engine → Continuous Monitoring
- Handover → State Continuity & Traceability

This structure parallels formal governance models.

## Change Management Mapping

Traditional change management requires:

- Defined request
- Impact analysis
- Approval
- Version control
- Documentation
- Audit trail

SAGT provides:

- Spec-first workflow (requirements/design/tasks)
- Mutation protocol
- Canon version increment
- Compiler validation
- HITL approval gate
- Execution logs

SAGT change control is deterministic and logged.

---

## Access & Authority Mapping

Compliance frameworks require:

- Defined roles
- Controlled authority
- Restricted modification rights
- Explicit privilege escalation

SAGT enforces:

- Task Group boundaries
- Protected zones
- Security model declaration
- Mutation-only structural changes
- HITL for authority escalation

Authority is layered and explicit.

---

## Auditability

Audit requires:

- Evidence of rule enforcement
- Traceable changes
- Logged decisions
- Deterministic reproduction

SAGT supports:

- Canon version logging
- Enforcement matrix
- Mutation history
- Policy telemetry logs
- Handover records
- Structured rule IDs

Execution can be replayed against canon version.

---

## Risk Management Mapping

Risk frameworks require:

- Identification of structural risks
- Mitigation controls
- Continuous monitoring
- Escalation triggers

SAGT provides:

- Protected zones
- Policy thresholds
- Shadow pattern detection
- Refusal enforcement
- Hard escalation via HITL

Risk is structurally mitigated.

---

## Secure Development Lifecycle Alignment

Secure SDLC models require:

- Threat modeling
- Boundary enforcement
- Controlled changes
- Review gates
- Logging

SAGT integrates:

- Security model in canon
- Protected security zones
- Mutation review
- Spec-first review
- HITL escalation
- Version traceability

Security is canonical, not optional.

---

## Determinism as Control Assurance

Compliance requires predictability.

SAGT enforces:

- Deterministic rule resolution
- Structured precedence
- Compiler validation
- Mutation versioning

This enables reproducible governance outcomes.

---

## Governance Evidence Artifacts

For audit purposes, SAGT can produce:

- Canon version history
- Mutation log
- Enforcement matrix export
- Policy metric reports
- Refusal frequency report
- HITL event log
- Spec archive

These artifacts support governance verification.

## What SAGT Does Not Replace

SAGT does not replace:

- Legal compliance review
- External audit processes
- Human risk assessment
- Regulatory interpretation

It provides structural governance for
