# Governance Adoption Guide

SAGT is not a feature.

It is an operating model.

Adoption must be deliberate.

This guide explains how teams transition from informal AI usage to governed AI-assisted development under SAGT.

---

## Why Adoption Requires Structure

Most teams already use AI.

However, common patterns include:

- Prompt-based iteration without traceability
- Architecture defined reactively
- Silent pattern drift
- Informal code generation
- Untracked structural changes

SAGT introduces discipline.

Adoption is less about adding rules and more about formalizing authority.

---

## Adoption Phases

Adoption should occur in phases.

Immediate full enforcement often causes friction.

Phased rollout allows governance to stabilize.

---

## Phase 1 — Canon Establishment

Objective:
Define structural authority.

Actions:

- Write initial ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md
- Define precedence
- Identify protected zones
- Establish mutation protocol
- Define task groups

Focus:
Clarity over completeness.

This phase moves the team from Level 0 to Level 1 maturity.

---

## Phase 2 — Spec Discipline

Objective:
Separate planning from execution.

Actions:

- Enforce spec-first workflow
- Require requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
- Introduce HITL approval gate
- Prevent execution before approval

Focus:
Temporal governance.

This phase prevents architecture from emerging implicitly.

---

## Phase 3 — Structured Enforcement

Objective:
Formalize rule validation.

Actions:

- Introduce Rule Schema v2
- Implement Canon Compiler
- Generate enforcement matrix
- Require compiler validation before execution

Focus:
Mechanical integrity.

This phase moves governance from advisory to enforceable.

---

## Phase 4 — Observability

Objective:
Detect slow drift.

Actions:

- Implement Policy Engine
- Log refusal frequency
- Track shadow pattern detection
- Monitor mutation frequency
- Establish governance review cadence

Focus:
Proactive stability.

This phase moves the system from reactive to preventative.

---

## Phase 5 — Deterministic Continuity

Objective:
Guarantee reproducibility.

Actions:

- Log canon version per execution
- Enforce handover protocol
- Validate multi-model consistency
- Require full spec discipline

Focus:
Long-term structural stability.

This phase completes Level 4 maturity.

---

## Organizational Role Alignment

SAGT does not require new job titles.

It clarifies responsibilities:

- Architects define canon.
- Developers write specs.
- Agents execute under governance.
- Humans approve mutation.
- Policy monitors system health.

Authority remains layered.

---

## Resistance Patterns

Common resistance includes:

- “This slows us down.”
- “The agent already does this.”
- “We can just be careful.”
- “This is too formal.”

Governance friction occurs only during transition.

Long-term velocity increases because drift decreases.

---

## Common Adoption Mistakes

1. Skipping protected zone definition.
2. Treating mutation as minor change.
3. Allowing skill authority creep.
4. Ignoring refusal events.
5. Collecting policy metrics but not reviewing them.
6. Weakening HITL enforcement.

Governance discipline must remain
