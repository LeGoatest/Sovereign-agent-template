# Operations Overview

The Operations layer defines how SAGT is used in real environments.

Doctrine defines structure.
Operations define practice.

Operations convert governance into repeatable process.

## Purpose of Operations

Operations ensure:

- Governance is applied consistently
- Mutation is disciplined
- Review cadence is established
- Drift is managed proactively
- Multi-model continuity is maintained

Without operational discipline, governance decays.

## Components of Operations

### Operational Playbook
Defines daily execution workflow under SAGT.

### Governance Maturity Model
Provides measurable adoption levels.

### Stress Scenarios
Simulates structural failure cases.

### Compliance Mapping
Maps SAGT structure to audit expectations.

### Adoption Guide
Guides teams from informal AI usage to governed AI usage.

## Governance as Infrastructure

SAGT must be treated like:

- A build system
- A compiler
- A security boundary
- A change-control mechanism

Operations ensure governance is institutionalized, not optional.

---

## Operations and Determinism

Operational discipline preserves determinism across:

- Time
- Team members
- Models
- Environments

Without operational rigor, determinism collapses.

Operations define how governance is lived.
