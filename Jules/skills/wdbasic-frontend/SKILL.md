# Skill: wdbasic-frontend

## Authority Boundary
Procedural only. No client-side state machines. STOP if SPA behavior is required.

## Reads First
- \`docs/DOC_STYLE.md\`
- \`docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md\`

## Procedure
1. Prefer server-rendered fragments.
2. HTMX is declarative: swaps, OOB updates, no custom JS unless canon-approved.
3. Keep layouts consistent with WDbasic component flows.
