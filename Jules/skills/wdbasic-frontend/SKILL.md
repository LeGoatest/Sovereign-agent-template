# Skill: wdbasic-frontend

## Authority Boundary
Procedural frontend implementation only.
No SPA-style client-side state machines.
STOP if the request requires client-side rendering architecture or custom runtime patterns outside canon.

## Reads First
- `docs/DOC_STYLE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md`

## Procedure
1. Prefer server-rendered HTML fragments and page composition.
2. Use HTMX declaratively for swaps and OOB updates.
3. Avoid custom JavaScript unless explicitly canon-approved.
4. Preserve semantic HTML, accessibility basics, and predictable layout structure.
5. Keep styling and component flow aligned with WDbasic patterns.

## Outputs
- Updated templates/fragments with clear section boundaries.
- Minimal style adjustments required for the requested UI behavior.
