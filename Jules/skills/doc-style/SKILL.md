# Skill: doc-style

## Authority Boundary
Procedural writing and formatting only.
Does NOT modify architecture policy intent.
If wording changes would alter canonical meaning, STOP.

## Reads First
- `docs/DOC_STYLE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md`

## Procedure
1. Normalize headings, list style, and code formatting.
2. Ensure terminology is consistent with canonical docs.
3. Keep precedence language and authority statements unchanged in meaning.
4. Resolve broken or outdated document links.
5. Keep edits minimal and directly scoped to style/clarity.

## Outputs
- Updated markdown that passes style checks.
- A short note listing significant wording normalizations.
