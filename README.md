# sovereign-agent-template

A reusable governance + execution template for AI coding agents (including Google Jules).

This repository is intentionally project-blind:
- It provides process, constraints, and scaffolding.
- It does not define product architecture for any specific application.
- Project-specific architecture and stack choices are created in downstream repos via specs.

## What this provides

- Canonical document precedence (law-first)
- Task group classification before action
- Skills as approved procedures (no implicit invention)
- Spec mode: plan → tasks → execute

## How to use

1) Open this repository in your agent environment.
2) Paste the prompt from \`NEW_PROJECT.md\`.
3) Create a spec for your project using \`Jules/specs/_template/\`.
4) Execute tasks only when explicitly instructed.

## Canon wins

Precedence is defined in \`docs/ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md\`.
Skills and specs are subordinate to canon.
