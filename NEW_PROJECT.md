# New Project Prompt

If you are starting a new project or bringing the Sovereign Agent into an existing one, paste the following prompt:

---

**Follow JULES.md and ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md.**
**Validate all requests against ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md.**
**If a request conflicts with canonical rules, you MUST refuse.**
**Classify every request into a TASK_GROUP before proceeding.**
**Use Spec Mode (.jtasks) for all non-trivial feature development.**
**Always respect the precedence hierarchy.**

Read this repository and treat it as the canonical project template.
Initialize governance, task groups, and skills exactly as defined here.
Create an initial specification using the provided spec templates in `.jtasks/_template/`.
Do not execute tasks unless explicitly instructed.

---

This ensures the Agent immediately adopts the Sovereign governance model.
