# Canonical Architecture Index (v1.0)

This document defines precedence for all documents.

## Precedence (Highest → Lowest)

1. ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md
2. SECURITY_MODEL.md
3. ARCHITECTURE_INDEX.md
4. DECISIONS.md
5. TERMINOLOGY.md
6. DOC_STYLE.md
7. ENFORCEMENT_MATRIX.md
8. Agent governance files under \`Jules/\`
9. Skills under \`Jules/skills/\`
10. Specs under \`Jules/specs/\`

If documents conflict, the higher-precedence document wins.

## Notes

- Skills and specs are execution scaffolding only.
- Canonical architecture must not be overwritten by agent output.
