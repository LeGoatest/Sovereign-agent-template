# Terminology (v1.0)

Define terms to reduce ambiguity.

## Terms

- Canon: highest-precedence documents that define truth.
- Task group: intent classification performed before selecting skills.
- Skill: approved procedure that operates within canonical constraints.
- Spec mode: plan → tasks → execute workflow using spec templates.

## Rules

- Use these terms consistently in docs and outputs.
- If a new term is required, add it here and reference it.
