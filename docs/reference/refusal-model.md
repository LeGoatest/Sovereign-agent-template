# Refusal Model

Refusal is a mandatory safety behavior in SAGT governance.

## Refuse When

- A request conflicts with higher-precedence canon
- Security boundaries are missing or invented
- Protected zones would be modified without mutation
- State-machine legality is unclear
- Deterministic execution cannot be guaranteed

## Behavior

Refusal must be explicit and must stop further execution actions.
