# Documentation Style (v1.0)

## Output constraints

- Prefer short, direct sentences.
- Use consistent headings and terminology from TERMINOLOGY.md.
- Avoid inventing behavior. Cite existing canon in the repo.

## Formatting rule: inline backticks

When writing markdown that contains inline code, escape inline backticks as \`.

Example:
- Write \`someIdentifier\` rather than unescaped inline backticks.

## Formatting rule: do not nest code fences

Do not place triple backticks inside a fenced code block.
If you must refer to triple backticks literally, write them as \`\`\`.
