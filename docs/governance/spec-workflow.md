# Spec Workflow

Non-trivial work follows a spec-first workflow.

## Required Artifacts

- `requirements.md`
- `design.md`
- `tasks.md`

## Sequence

1. Confirm task-group classification.
2. Produce spec artifacts.
3. Wait for explicit human instruction to execute.
4. Execute only approved tasks.

## Guardrail

No implementation changes are allowed during spec generation.
