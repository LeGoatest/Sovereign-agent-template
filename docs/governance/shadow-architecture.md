# Shadow Architecture

Shadow architecture is any structural pattern introduced without canon authority.

## Rule

Agents must not introduce architecture that is not explicitly authorized by canon.

## If Needed

When a new pattern is required:

1. Do not silently adopt it.
2. Initiate formal canon mutation.
3. Require human validation before proceeding.
